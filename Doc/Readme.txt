 @par How to use it ?
open the Macro in stm32f0xx.h file,
enable one of above:
 	/*#define STM32F030*/
  /* #define STM32F031 */   
  /* #define STM32F051 */   
  /* #define STM32F072 */
  /* #define STM32F070xB */   
  /* #define STM32F042 */
  /* #define STM32F070x6 */   
  /* #define STM32F091 */
  /* #define STM32F030xC */ 

      - STM32F051: to configure the project for STM32F051 devices.
                   You can use STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL or STM32F0-Discovery
                   board to run this project.

      - STM32F031: to configure the project for STM32F031 devices.
                   You need to use custom HW board to run this project.
